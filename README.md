# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
In this project, we take reviews of a specific product such as clothing apparel or wireless products and use PySpark to perform ETL to extract the data, transform the data and connect to an AWS RDS instance and finally load the transformed data into pgAdmin. Lastly, using either PySpark, Pandas, or SQL we determine if there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members.
